# Cryptocurrencies & Unsupervised Machine Learning

## Overview

To give customers of an investment bank a better understanding of the cryptocurrency market, unsupervised machine learning wwas used to cluster different crypto coins to try and create classifications for them, as well as giving a clear overview of which coins are available to trade, as well as which coins are being mined.

Seen below, an elbow curve is generated to determine that four different clusters are needed for this particular dataset.

Below is a 3d scatter plot, with the clusters and three PCA. Hovering over each of them, the name given is the name of the cryptocurrency, and the data is the algorithim.

With the provided data, an investment bank will be able to help generate investment portfolios catered to each of its customers looking to invest in one of the 532 tradeable coins.
